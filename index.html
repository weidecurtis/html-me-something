            So my friends and I were at my uncle's birthday party when he got drunk, cursed us all out, and then just vanished before our eyes. We didn't know what to think so I went back to his place to search for any clues and what-have-you's. When I got there he had already left, but his friend Gandalf was there and gave me my uncle's old ring. Then when he came back he asked me about it and threw it in the fire, then told me to take it to his friends a long ways away.

            My friend Sam decided to come with me. On the way there we ran into two of our other friends and then started being chased by some crazy dudes. We get to town and decide to go get drunk after that, so we do and we meet a guy who says he knows Gandalf and that I should be quiet.

            Aragorn, the guy we met at the bar, pretty much made us leave and told us some crazy dudes were coming to take us. We leave in a hurry and head to yet another town. This one a bit ritzy.

            On the way to the ritzy town, one of the crazy dudes stab me in the chest. It hurts so bad. Somehow Aragorn's girlfriend is hanging out and she has a faster car so she takes me to the ritzy town to see their doctors. I survive, the end.
